this is the Vivo v29 and there's three really special things about it for starters with this design Viva made over 1400 manual adjustments to magnetic fields to create this particular texture that you can see here there are 15 million particles per phone with the angle of each precisely tuned to get the right graduations of light and shadows second is the auralite with smart color temperature adjustments to help you easily take portrait shots in low light and night environments it's like a flash but just with nine times the light emitting area which basically makes it much softer and more sculpted light but also it can detect the color temperature of the room you're in and adjust its own color temperature to match so that your face looks clear soft and bright but as if you haven't even used a flash the third is that the selfie camera is wide enough to fit the entire group in while being 50 megapixels in resolution so selfies look almost like they've been taken on the rear set of cameras`,
